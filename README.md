## Problem statement
Download the data set about Value of Energy Cost Saving Program for businesses in New York City (under the "Export" option, there is a way to retrieve a CSV file). Answer the following questions.

4. Considering only NTAs with at least 5 listed businesses, what is the average total savings and the total jobs created for each NTA?
5. Save your result for the previous question as a CSV file.

- Day 5 plotting
1. scatter plot of jobs created versus average savings. Use both a standard and a logarithmic scale for the average savings.
2. histogram of the log of the average total savings.
3. line plot of the total jobs created for each month.

- Day 8
1. Use binder and upload solution to your GitHub repository.

# Using Binder to Host your Notebooks
[Binder](https://mybinder.org) is a great and free service that makes it easy for someone to share their Jupyter notebooks for others to both view and run. Binder works by taking a GitHub repository and building a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image. Using [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), Binder runs a Docker container of the built Docker image.
